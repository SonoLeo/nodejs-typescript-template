# Node.js TypeScript Template

This is a template for creating Node.js applications with TypeScript. It provides a basic structure and setup for a TypeScript Node.js project.

This project includes nodemon already configured, and eslint installed; you are just going to have to add your own rules to the **.eslintrc** file.

## Getting started

To use this template, you will first need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/SonoLeo/typescript-nodejs-template.git
cd nodejs-typescript-template
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies to get started with the template.

## Running the application

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will use ts-node to run the src/index.ts file, which is the entry point for the application. You should see output in the console indicating that the server is running.
